# Advent of Code

This repository holds the solutions to all of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems I have participated in so far. Every folder in this repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code corresponding to that year.

Here's every year I've participated in Advent of Code and the language I used for each year:

 * 2019 -- Haskell
 * 2020 -- Rust
 * 2021 -- Scala (except for Day 15, which was done in C++, and Day 16 and 20, which were done in Python, in successful attempts to make the [Day 15](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/day/15), [Day 16](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/day/16), and [Day 20](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/day/20) leaderboards)
 * 2022 -- Rust (except for Days 2, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, and 19, which were done in Python, and Days 16 and 20, which were done in C++, in successful attempts to make the [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/2), [Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/7), [Day 9](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/9), [Day 10](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/10), [Day 11](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/11), [Day 12](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/12), [Day 13](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/13), [Day 14](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/14), [Day 16](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/16), [Day 17](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/17), [Day 19](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/19), and [Day 20](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/20) leaderboards)
   - I placed 44th on [the overall 2022 leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard).
 * 2023 -- Python, all solutions except Day 3 were attempts to make the leaderboard. I successfully made the [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/day/1), [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/day/2), [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/day/4), [Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/day/5), [Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/day/7), [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8), and [Day 9](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/day/9) leaderboards.

Note that solutions which were done in attempts to make the leaderboard will be significantly messier than the other solutions, since I have preserved those solutions as I originally wrote them when I was trying to code the solution as fast as possible to make the leaderboard. Solutions which were done in attempts to make the leaderboard also sometimes only work because of an assumption I made which worked for my puzzle input, but may not be true for all puzzle inputs.
