# Advent of Code

This repository holds the solutions to all of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems I have participated in so far. Every folder in this repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code corresponding to that year.

Here's every year I've participated in Advent of Code and the language I used for each year:

 * 2019 -- Haskell
 * 2020 -- Rust
 * 2021 -- Scala (except for Day 15, which was done in C++ in a successful attempt to make [that day's leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/day/15))
