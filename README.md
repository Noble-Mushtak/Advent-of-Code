# Advent of Code

This repository holds the solutions to all of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems I have participated in so far. Every folder in this repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code corresponding to that year.

 * 2019 -- Haskell
 * 2020 -- Rust
 * 2021 -- Scala (except for Day 15, which was done in C++, and Day 16 and 20, which were done in Python, in successful attempts to make the [Day 15](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/day/15), [Day 16](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/day/16), and [Day 20](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/day/20) leaderboards)
