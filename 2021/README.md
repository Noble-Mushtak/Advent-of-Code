# Advent of Code 2021

This folder contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2021, which I solved using Scala 2.13.4.

The solution to both parts for day `XX` are contained in the `main.scala` file in the `dayXX` folder. I have not uploaded my puzzle inputs to this GitHub repo, but you can run the scripts on your own puzzle inputs in the command line as follows:

    scala main.scala /path/to/in.txt

where `/path/to/in.txt` is the path to the file containing the puzzle input for that day.
