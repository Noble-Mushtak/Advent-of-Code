Both `solution.cpp` and `solution2.cpp` assume that the puzzle input has been modified by adding a line at the top of the input specifying how many numbers were in the original puzzle input.

For example, the sample input should be transformed to the following:

    7
    1
    2
    -3
    3
    -2
    0
    4

Notice how the "7" at the top of the sample input has been added to indicate that the original sample input contained 7 numbers.
