# Advent of Code

This repository holds the solutions to all of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems I have participated in so far. Every folder in this repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code corresponding to that year. 2019 was my first year participating in Advent of Code, so right now, I only have one years' worth of solutions, but hopefully, in the future, I will add more solutions every year.
